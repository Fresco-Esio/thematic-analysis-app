## Project Identity

This is a **React-based visual workspace** for **Braun & Clarke Reflexive Thematic Analysis** — a qualitative research methodology for academic and research contexts. It is **not** a clinical tool, diagnostic instrument, or therapeutic application.

**Reference:** Braun, V. & Clarke, V. (2006). Using thematic analysis in psychology. *Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3*(2), 77–101. Updated reflexive TA framework (2019+).

## State Shape

```js
// GraphContext
{ nodes: [], edges: [], regions: [] }

// Node — theme
{ id, type: 'theme', label, color, x, y, wallPosition? }

// Node — code
{ id, type: 'code', label, quote, source, primaryThemeId, color, x, y, wallPosition? }

// Edge
{ id, source, target }

// Region — a theme's territory on the Wall view
{ id: 'region-<themeId>', themeId, rect: { x, y, w, h } }

// Report — Living Report chapters (ids reference nodes: renames flow through,
// deleted themes/codes render as tombstones — never cascade-deleted)
{ sections: [{ themeId, proseBlocks: [{ id, text }], pullQuoteIds: [codeId] }] }
```

`wallPosition` (`{x, y}`) is the card's **authored** position on the Wall — independent of the physics `x`/`y`. Codes with neither `primaryThemeId` nor `wallPosition` sit in the Wall's UNSORTED tray.

**Reducer actions:** `ADD_NODES` `ADD_NODE` `UPDATE_NODE` `DELETE_NODE` `DELETE_NODES` `BULK_ASSIGN_THEME` `ADD_EDGE` `DELETE_EDGE` `UPDATE_EDGE` `ADD_REGION` `UPDATE_REGION` `DELETE_REGION` `UNASSIGN_CODE` `REPORT_ADD_BLOCK` `REPORT_UPDATE_BLOCK` `REPORT_DELETE_BLOCK` `REPORT_SET_ORDER` `REPORT_ADD_PULL_QUOTE` `REPORT_REMOVE_PULL_QUOTE` `SET_GRAPH` `CLEAR`

**localStorage keys:**
- `thematic_analysis_graph_v2` — graph state (current; includes `regions` + `wallPosition`)
- `thematic_analysis_graph_v1` — legacy graph state; read once by `migrateV1ToV2()` and **never overwritten** (rollback safety)
- `thematic_analysis_physics_v1` — physics params

**v1 → v2 migration** (`migrateV1ToV2` in GraphContext.js, exported for tests): seeds each node's `wallPosition` from its physics x/y and creates one 440×320 region per theme, centered on the theme's last position. Runs in the lazy initializer only when no v2 key exists.

## App-Level UI State (App.js)

| State | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `importOpen` | boolean | ImportModal visibility |
| `codeEditId` | string\|null | CodeEditModal target node id |
| `themeEditId` | string\|null | ThemeEditModal target node id |
| `connectMode` | boolean | Edge-drawing mode active |
| `physicsOpen` | boolean | PhysicsPanel visibility |
| `searchOpen` | boolean | Toolbar search bar expanded |
| `searchQuery` | string | Current search string |
| `searchFilters` | `{themes, codes}` | Node type filter toggles |
| `focusThemeId` | string\|null | Active focus-view theme; null = no focus |
| `view` | `'wall'\|'graph'\|'sankey'\|'report'` | Active center panel; `'graph'` default. Graph-only toolbar actions (Connect, zoom, Fit View, Align, Physics) disable via `graphOnly` prop on `TbBtn`. Sankey is read-mostly: code click opens CodeEditModal; export id lives on its figure frame. Report: prose commits on blur (one undo entry per edit session); ↓ PDF triggers `window.print()` via reportPrint.css instead of html2canvas |

---

## Critical Conventions

- **State:** All updates go through `graphReducer` via `dispatch`. Never mutate context directly.
- **Reducer cases must spread state:** any case that returns an object literal must `{ ...state, ... }` — a bare `{ nodes, edges }` silently **drops `regions`** (and any future top-level key).
- **History (undo/redo):** `POSITION_ONLY_KEYS = {x, y, wallPosition}` — `UPDATE_NODE` touching only these is not undoable (drags don't spam history). `UPDATE_REGION` with only `rect` changes is likewise non-undoable. Assignment (`BULK_ASSIGN_THEME`, `UNASSIGN_CODE`) IS undoable — it's an analytic act.
- **D3 / React split:** D3 owns `x`/`y` positions via force simulation. React owns rendering. Never let D3 touch the DOM. The Wall uses d3.zoom only — no simulation; card positions are authored (`wallPosition`).
- **Wall assignment is placement:** dropping a card fully inside exactly one region assigns it (`BULK_ASSIGN_THEME`); dropping on empty wall unassigns (`UNASSIGN_CODE`); ambiguous placement keeps assignment + shows a contested "?" badge. Decision logic is pure — `assignmentAfterDrop()` in wallGeometry.js.
- **Wall z-order:** regions → string SVG → cards, but region label plates have `zIndex: 1` so strings never cover theme names. String anchors use `stringAnchorOnRegion()` (center-ray, continuous — do not revert to nearest-edge, it snaps at corners).
- **Export ID:** the mounted view's export root has `id="canvas-export-target"` (Canvas root, WallView root, SankeyView's fixed-ratio figure frame, or ReportView's edit root — only one renders at a time; ReportView's present overlay intentionally has none, PNG export no-ops there). `exportUtils.js` and `App.js` both depend on this — do not rename.
- **Physics reactivity:** `useDragAndSimulation(nodes, edges, onTick, physicsParams)` — accepts `physicsParams` as a prop and has a `useEffect` calling `simulation.current.updateParams(physicsParams)` on changes.
- **Persistence:** `useReducer` uses a **lazy initializer** (third argument) to read localStorage synchronously before first render. Do not replace this with an effect-based restore — it causes a race condition where the save effect fires with empty state before the restore dispatches.
- **Components:** Functional components only. No class components.
- **Styling:** Tailwind for layout/spacing. Inline `style` for dynamic or animation-driven values. Never use `var(--css-var)` inside Tailwind arbitrary value syntax (e.g. `shadow-[...]`) — JIT cannot resolve them at build time.
- **PhysicsPanel transition:** The panel has a 0.25s CSS `width` transition. Wait 300ms after opening before interacting in tests.
- **Modal Escape handlers:** Each modal's `useEffect` for Escape must guard `if (!node) return;` before installing the listener, and include `node` in its deps array. This prevents a stale listener when the modal is closed.
- **Framer Motion nodes:** Use `motion.div` with `role="button"` — not `motion.button`. Playwright can detect `role="button"` reliably; `motion.button` has known interaction issues in tests.
- **Context menu ARIA:** Container has `role="menu"`, each item has `role="menuitem"`. E2E tests use `getByRole('menuitem', { name: /.../ })`.

## Canvas Features Added in UI Redesign

### Search
- `matchedNodeIds` — `useMemo` Set; nodes that match `searchQuery` + `searchFilters`
- Unmatched nodes render at 25% opacity when search is active
- Matched nodes get `4px 4px 0 #dc2626` red highlight shadow

### Alignment
- `handleAlign()` in App.js dispatches `UPDATE_NODE` for all nodes (radial layout: themes on outer ring, codes sub-ringed around their theme)
- After dispatch, calls `alignTriggerRef.current()` → `simulation.alpha(0.5).restart()`
- `forceSimulation.js` wraps D3 and exposes chainable `alpha(val)` and `restart()`

### Focus View
- `focusThemeId` state; passed as prop to Canvas
- `focusedNodeIds` — `useMemo` Set of theme + connected codes
- D3 zoom transitions (600ms cubic-bezier) to cluster bounding box when `focusThemeId` changes
- Non-focused nodes dim; "✕ Exit Focus" pill at canvas bottom; Escape also exits
- Context menu on theme nodes shows "⊙ Focus View" between Rename and Delete

## Domain Terminology

| Use | Avoid |
|---|---|
| researcher / analyst | clinician / therapist / practitioner |
| participant | patient / client |
| qualitative data | assessment data |
| coded excerpt / quote | symptom / case note |
| theme / thematic map | diagnosis / formulation |
| Braun & Clarke TA | CBT / clinical framework |
| reflexive thematic analysis | clinical analysis |

## Import Pipeline

- Supported formats: `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.xls` (multi-sheet Excel supported)
- Flexible header matching via `HEADER_MAP` in `importUtils.js`
- Required column: `Code` / `Code (Comment)` — rows without a value are skipped
- Optional: `Source`, `Quoted Text` / `Quote`, `Preliminary Theme` / `Theme`
- Existing theme labels are reused; new unique labels create new theme nodes
- ImportModal is scrollable (`max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto`) for large preview tables

## Bug History (do not re-introduce)

| # | Issue | Fix applied |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Export was a no-op — no `id="canvas-export-target"` element | Added `id` to Canvas root div |
| 2 | Physics sliders had no effect after simulation init | `useDragAndSimulation` now accepts `physicsParams` and calls `updateParams()` reactively |
| 3 | Deleting a theme left codes with stale `primaryThemeId` | `DELETE_NODE` reducer unassigns dependent codes |
| 4 | localStorage race condition on mount — save effect overwrote persisted data | Replaced effect-based restore with `useReducer` lazy initializer |
| 5 | Zoom-to-cluster effect missing `graphState.nodes` dep | Added `graphState.nodes` to the focus-view `useEffect` dep array |
| 6 | Unassigned codes cluster missing angle offset | Fixed `handleAlign()` — added `- Math.PI / 2` so unassigned ring starts at 12 o'clock |
| 7 | Modal Escape handler installed even when modal was closed | Added `if (!node) return;` guard and `node` to deps array in CodeEditModal and ThemeEditModal |
| 8 | ImportModal cut off when content exceeded viewport height | Added `max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto` to modal container div |
| 9 | E2E selectors broke after ARIA role additions | Updated `app.spec.js`: `getByRole('button')` → `getByRole('menuitem')`; `.border-t.border-slate-700` → `.border-t-2` |
| 10 | Reducer cases returning bare `{ nodes, edges }` literals silently dropped `regions` when it was added to state | Every case now spreads `...state`; convention documented above — new top-level state keys require auditing all object-literal returns |
| 11 | Wall drop position read from React state in `pointerup` — lagging state lost the drop | Drop position lives in `dragStateRef.lastPos` (ref), state Map is render-only |
| 12 | Wall cards snapped their center to the cursor on grab | Grab offset recorded on `pointerdown` and applied during the drag |
| 13 | String anchors snapped between region edges at corner crossings (nearest-edge rule) | `stringAnchorOnRegion()` uses center-ray border intersection — continuous; plates render above strings via `zIndex: 1` |
| 14 | Tray→wall drag broke pointer capture when the card remounted into the wall layer | Tray card stays mounted during the drag; a non-interactive ghost follows the cursor on the wall |
